        I'm Jakob, a 28-year-old web developer born and raised in Kalmar,
        Sweden. 🌍 I discovered my passion for web development a few years ago
        and have since focused on honing my skills, particularly in frontend
        development. 💻 I love creating dynamic and interactive user experiences
        through animations and innovative designs. ✨ Challenges motivate me,
        and I thrive on finding creative solutions to complex problems. 💪 In my
        spare time, I enjoy hanging out with friends, golfing, hitting the gym,
        playing football, and traveling. 🏌️‍♂️🏋️‍♂️⚽✈️
